[{"content":"The Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has had multiple effects on worldwide film production, distribution, and viewing.\n\nThe pandemic has had the short term effect of making some films more available for home viewing. It is not altogether clear yet if that will prove to be an enduring trend. The fact that this tendency was already emerging before the pandemic could indicate that it is a long term trend.\n\nBefore looking at general trends that go beyond particular films in this *Bullet Comments* section of *The Movie Shrink* site, let us say a few words about our goals in this section.\n\nIn other postings on this site, we pointed out that, to identify the films that we make somewhat extensive specific comments on, we must look at many other films for which we will make less extensive comments.\n\nSome of these films could be amenable to hermeneutic understanding, but time constraints and other factors make it difficult to comment extensively on a large number of films. In addition, other films simply do not lend themselves to hermeneutic analysis.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid the following risk: If indeed, hermeneutics is everything, and can apply to anything, then it runs the risk of being nothing.\n\nThat having been said, here are, nevertheless, some limited and brief comments we can offer on a variety of relatively recent films. We are, in this case, interested in general trends more than in particular films. That being said, a few of the films briefly mentioned here may give way to more detailed analyses in the main feature section of *The Movie Shrink*.\n\nAmong the films of late 2018, 2019, and early 2020 for which we will offer our *Bullet Comments*, there will be films from North America and other parts of the world.\n\nLooking at films of 2018, 2019 and 2020, *The* *Movie Shrink* can, indeed, identify several trends. We can distinguish between more difficult to identify trends and those that are more obvious.\n\nIn the first category of more difficult to identify trends, two trends stand out: first, the contemporary pressures coming from time constraints and media transformation, and, second, the dynamics of institutions.\n\nAmong the more obvious trends stands the age- old theme of the tension and relations between the haves and the have nots. This age-old and enduring theme in cinema offers particular twists in films of more recent years.\n\nOne of those twists concerns the theme of being black in America and, secondly, the more worldwide reassessment of the role of women.\n\nSo let us start with the more challenging to identify trends.\n\nThe first of these not so obvious trends is the question of time, or the pressures of time in contemporary societies, worldwide.\n\nThe first film to come to mind in this category is Ken Loach’s **Sorry We Missed You** (2019), a British-French-Belgian drama (which received numerous prizes), that chronicles the pressures, in terms of time especially, put on a British family where the husband is heavily involved in a corporate privatization scheme of parcel delivery services, under which he becomes financially responsible for the inevitable delays and problems encountered. The scheme is not as profitable as expected, not counting that it is destroying his family life.\n\nAnother dimension to this theme of time is presented in **Hummingbird** (2018), featured in our main feature section, a Canadian-Belgian drama that brings another angle to the pressures of time. These pressures are seen here from the side of the winners, where the main characters are planning a scheme to save time in stock market transactions to gain millions of dollars. But, here too, time is of the essence, because a rival plan could be operational before their own. It is, quite literally, a race against time.\n\nEarlier, in 2016, a film out of Bulgaria, **Glory**, suggested that the problem of time, and time constraints, are universal. In this story, a Bulgarian trackman, after finding lost money on the railroad tracks, turns it over to the government, only to find himself become a media persona, deprived of his old and dependable watch (called *Glory*) in favor of a new but malfunctioning digital watch, by an unscrupulous media relations official, herself living from minute to minute under the dictates of her cellphone.\n\nRelated to this theme of the pressures of time is the theme of the changes in the media landscape, in this early first century of the millennium.\n\n**The Hunt,** a horror-thriller American film of early 2020, does not leave much to be interpreted, as it only pushes further the existing cultural tensions in America, where cultural elites are seen here as hunting rednecks in a park, under the influence of media wars which started on the Internet.\n\nAnother American film, **A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood** (2020), featured in our main section, tells of a time where the media outlets were more benevolent, helpful and even sweet, as the kind and loving star of the children show classic of an earlier time, *Mr. Roger’s* *Neighborhood*, Fred Rogers, is anything but a revengeful and hateful participant on the Internet. The film suggests how far we have moved from these gentler times.\n\nIn our second category of films that are more challenging to understand stands the theme of institutions.\n\nThis theme of institutions might seem a little too abstract for films of fiction, but *The Movie* *Shrink* is convinced they are quite present, if only in an indirect way.\n\n**First Cow** (2019), featured in our main section, can be seen as a film on the birth of an institutional framework under primitive conditions. The film is about the rough life in an Oregon settlement at the beginning of the nineteenth century, where the two principal characters steal from an administrative official the milk of a cow, the one and only cow of the settlement. In this film, the founding elements of institutional life are composed of a mixed bag of different and somewhat primitive elements: physical intimidation, fear, revenge, corporal punishment, self-administered justice, tempered by emerging public authorities and the basic rules of a market economy.\n\nEven when institutions are settled and stable, they may hide some more primitive and unrecognized elements. Such is the case with Asghar Farhadi’s **Everybody Knows** (2018). The film revolves around the mother of all institutions, marriage. A marriage celebration in rural Spain turns out to be less of a celebration and more an unwelcomed opportunity to revisit some shaky foundations of the family involved. Under the varnish of institutions, there are dark secrets and hidden truths.\n\nAnother dimension of institutions is suggested in Elia Suleiman’s **It Must Be Haven** (2019). The underlying dimension here is the suggestion that institutions, and institutional life, once established, have automaticity and permanence to them, to the point that they can, to a certain point, escape reality. This story turns around a Palestinian filmmaker who is looking for financing for his films in France and in the United States. He does not find the financing he wants, but he is witness to *haute couture* and *chic* that seems to awkwardly permeate all public life in Paris, while sirens and implicit violence was ever-present in the American city he visits. Suleiman is no kinder to his own Palestinian homeland, where the characters have well established and dysfunctional (and sometimes ridiculous) habits of their own. Institutional life, once established, is hard to change. We mechanically reproduce our institutions without questioning them.\n\nLet us now turn to the more easily identifiable recent themes, which can be summed up by the notion of the relations between the haves and the have nots.\n\nTwo of the most celebrated films of recent years have touched upon that unavoidable theme. It is telling that both movies end up in violence, a testimony to the tensions between the haves and the have nots.\n\nIn Todd Phillips’ **Joker** (2019), this psychological thriller chronicles the fight of the main character, the Joker, a failed stand-up comic, against the wealthy. In **Parasite** (2019), there is a South-Korean twist to the tensions between the haves and the have nots. It is, first, the fact that the tensions between the wealthy family and the poor family are not accompanied by a cultural divide, as is the case in the United States, as evidenced in **The Hunt**. Quite the opposite, the two opposing families have much the same cultural underpinnings, witnessed by the fact that the poor one can almost seamlessly take the place of the rich one, and even take part in the education of their children. Another South-Korean trait is that, in **Parasite,** the economic inequalities are not so much between individuals as between families, which is a confirmation of political scientist-sociologist Francis Fukuyama’s view that, expressed in his classic book *Trust* (1995), Korea’s economic success was, at the outset, built on a combination of family and government institutions ( whereas Japan’s success was based on evolving feudalism).\n\nThe tensions between the haves and the have nots have recently witnessed some additional contemporary dimensions, most present in North America.\n\nIndeed, in North America, there are two themes which have recently kept our attention: films on the experience of being black in America, on the one hand, and films about the rise of female consciousness, on the other hand.\n\nIn the case of the experience of being black in America, the films that look at this question are often quite straightforward and do not need much interpretation from *The Movie Shrink*. That is the case with **The Green Book** (2018), **If Beale Street Could Speak** (2018), **Moonlight** (2016) and **Ma** (2019). In the case of **Get Out** (2017), released earlier, there may be more implicit elements, which may need to be looked at. For example, the fact that blacks, in the home of the hero’s white sweetheart, are kidnapped to use their body parts, is very intriguing and demands a second look. The implicit message, the elephant behind the film, as it were, might be that blacks are, yes, integrated to American society, but they are integrated only in specialized roles, not of course as body parts literally, but in very specialized roles, as musicians and sports figures for example. The more recent **Us** (2019), from the same director, is more difficult to decipher, and we will try to do this work more extensively in our feature section. This episode of a black family attacked by another black family, exactly similar to itself, as they are vacationing in their summer home near the beach, is very intriguing. It is difficult to identify the elephant behind the film. But because white families face the same danger from white families similar to themselves, in the small vacation village, it seems appropriate to take away an exclusively black interpretation of the film. Does the concluding images of the attackers, black and white, holding hands to traverse America from coast to coast suggest that to find unity, we must first face our demons, our social tensions, tensions between haves and have nots? Possibly, but not entirely clear.\n\nStill on films produced that speak to inequality, **The Favorite** (2018) and **Mary, Queen of Scots** (2018) both continue the rich vein of reassessing the role of women in society, a theme very present in recent years. A more recent aspect of this reassessment, present in both films, may be that the rivalry is less exclusively between men and women but now includes rivalry between women. That observation might not be welcomed by all, but it flows from some of the recent films on the subject. Whether that element is a sign of progress or of a retreat is not altogether clear.\n\nWith this, we conclude our August 4, 2020 entry in this section of *Bullet Comments.*","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"The Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has had multiple effects on worldwide film production, distribution, and viewing.\n\nThe pandemic has had the short term effect of making some films more available for home viewing.

Drama/romance.\n\n# INTRODUCING THE STORY\n\n**(this is a spoiler alert: do not read this section if you wish to follow the plot only at the screening of the film)**\n\nIn this most recent film presented by veteran and acclaimed director Zhangke Jia, the story revolves around Qiao, female companion of a local mafia boss named Bin. The film presents Qiao’s story, which starts in Datong, a run down and declining mining city of China, where she assists her Mafiosi husband in his various negotiations and responsibilities, working from an equally run down and non-descript semi-legal bar.\n\nIn the context of this economically challenged town, Qiao is the daughter of a laid-off worker, who laments the loss of his job. We can even hear his lamentations on the local radio station of this economically depressed environment, but to no avail. Not much can be done in the face of larger economic interests.\n\nQiaos’s companion (Bin) has his own worries, as he is involved in local Mafioso turf wars. At one point, he is attacked in his car by a dozen or so violent youths who are beating him up quite badly, until Qiao, taking the matter in her own hands to protect Bin, warns the violent youths that the next they will hear from her is through a gun she is waving at them.\n\nThe public authorities investigating the incident want to know where she got the gun, and to protect her companion from prosecution, she keeps that information for herself, fearing that that information could jeopardize the whole of Bin’s future. All of which results in five years of prison for her. Bin does not seem to go out of his way to help her.\n\nAfter serving her prison term, she sets out to find Bin, and realizes he has not progressed much in her absence. In fact he now appears weak and diminished, psychologically and physically. In response to Bin’s lament that he has lost his compass, she replies that he « was », at one time, ,a mafia chief, but is no more.\n\nBefore locating Bin, her journey outside prison had brought her through large sections of China, to different location, using different transportation modes. In the process, she meets less than recommendable individuals, including a fellow passenger who steals her money and documents.\n\nHer journey also leads her to the site of the transformation of the Yangtze River, with important water redirection, and where the giant Three Gorges dam is being constructed.\n\nQiao’s journey is also her own evolution, her personal trajectory, from a female companion of a local Mafioso boss to being her own woman, so to speak, complete with moral fortitude and even some undeniable wisdom.\n\nMen around her are weakening all along. Her father lost his former status, as we have seen, and her male companion’s social slide downward parallels her own rise.\n\n# THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE FILM\n\nWhen looking at such a film, the unavoidable question is whether this tale says something, more generally, about contemporary China itself.\n\nIn the spirit of *The Movie Shrink*, we are unable to resist this temptation here.\n\nThere is a large consensus that China is experiencing profound and large scale changes. But how these mutations affect individual lives is a question more difficult to identify and understand. This is where art and art work, and of course films, can provide what formal sociology and economics cannot.\n\nAnd so, in this spirit, let us look more closely at some of the elements of **Ash is purest white**.\n\nThe film seems to suggest the possibility that men (as compared to women) may be particularly disoriented by the disconcerting mutations of modern China. Indeed men, even today, are still more involved in the work force, where these seismic changes are more directly felt. More specifically, rapid and important changes in the scale of organized life, from the local sphere, from which both Qiao’s father and her companion Bin drew their authority, to the larger, sometimes gigantic, contemporary projects of modern China, where a personal, concrete authority is more difficult to identify. Much is lost in these mutations, at least temporarily, and particularly for men in the work force (and that includes the mafia level of organization, like any organization). The dozen young men attacking veteran Mafioso Bin on the street are witnesses and participants to these changes of scale.\n\nReflecting on this film, and going apparently in the same direction as we propose here, *Slant Magazine* critic Sam C. Mac refers to a « profound statement on the spatial and temporal dissonances that inform life in 21th century China », creating a « national malaise » ( Peter Bradshaw, in *The Guardian*).\n\nMany cross-currents of scale are presently at play in China. Many contradictory currents have indeed been referred to in order to describe contemporary China. Some point out to privatization, on the one hand, others to the continued large role of the State, on the other hand, heavily involved in large infrastructure construction, like the giant Three Gorges dam shown in the film. While privatization is no doubt on the move, it does not preclude the continued importance of large centralized government action, all of which contributes to the endless and inconclusive arguments for or against privatization , since a lot of partly contradictory cross-currents are happening at the same time. While there is the tendency to move out of centralized government and down to the operational level, the age old tradition of large government, best described by Karl Wittfogel in his classic *Oriental Despotism*, in which much of the centralization occurring historically in China was related to large water diversion projects, in the same spirit as the contemporary Three Gorges electricity facility, shown in the film, is still very present and pertinent.\n\nLet us return to the film’s main character, companion of the deposed mafia leader Bin, and to the film’s Chinese title, quite different from the title in French (***Les éternels***) and also different from the title in English (***Ash is purest white***).\n\nThe title in Chinese, if we are to believe the literal translation, refers in part to the notion of *Jianghu*, made up of two words, river and lake, and , taken together, meaning wetlands and, sociologically, a period of uncertainty and of the suspension of normal rules and the arrival of a different and particular set of ethics. Wikipedia adds that these instances of *Jianghu* take on a particular importance in periods of uncertainty and trouble.\n\n# THE BIG PICTURE\n\nThe film’s story line suggests that women are less affected than men in this period of *Jianghu*.\n\nIs that to say that, in China, as elsewhere, there is a swing towards more power to women, just as there is in films coming out of the West (***The Favorite, Queen of Scots*** and many others) ? It is, after all, now, a global world, a global village.\n\nIn ***Ash is purest white***, we are witness to this global trend, with a particular Chinese twist to it.\n\nAs the ecologists suggest: the more local, the more universal. It may be the case here.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"China is no doubt experiencing major socio-economic transformations at this moment in its history.

This causes some personal dilemmas, because her eventual accusation stemming from her unlawful activities would prevent her from being an acceptable parent for the adoption agency.\n\nAnd, so, her secret ecological activities must be all the more secret.\n\nBut the police, as expected, is closing in on her activities, and on her. The police’s progress is entirely due to technical expertise, and not to any leaking of information, even though there is no absence of persons who could have denounced her. Her choir male friend, involved in his working life in government, at the highest level, does not reveal her activities. A farmer, whose operations are situated near her monkeywrenching and illegal activities, protects her from inquiring police patrols, and even lends her one of his vehicles for her to sneak out of his neighbouring pastures. In an incidental conversation with her, the rugged but aiding farmer had mentioned that they could be related, possibly as cousins.\n\nLater in the film, towards its conclusion, after Halla is identified and arrested, her twin sister Asa, whose life project of her own was to reach her guru in India for an extended stay of spirituality, agrees to trick the authorities of the prison in changing place with Halla, since the prison would offer her the solitude and reflection opportunities that would have been possible in India, leaving Halla free to take custody of her new Ukrainian daughter after her tricky exit from prison and arrival in war stricken and somewhat disorganized Ukraine. Before this odd and somewhat spectacular exchange of prisoner, Halla had told her twin sister that she kept her activities out of her sister’s knowledge, in order to protect her from being also accused by the authorities.\n\n# THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE FILM\n\nAt first glance, this film is an ecological fable, presented however with a certain degree of humor. Often appearing on the screen is an intriguing musical trio providing a somewhat comical soundtrack and, later, another group, this time of Ukrainian folk dancers, also appears somewhat awkwardly, on the film set. This de- dramatizes the ecological struggle of the heroin. The ecological battle does not, consequently, appear to be so urgent or pressing, as these two artistic trios appear and disappear uninvited on the film set, providing some comical dimension to the whole story.\n\nThis comical element brings us to conclude that we may have to go beyond the ecological fable to grasp the essence of the film.\n\nThe film may indeed not be so much about the pressing environmental struggles as it is on the necessary underlying bases for these post-modern concerns. The elephant on the screen, which can be easily overlooked, like most elephants on the screen, that is to say too obvious to notice, may very well be the particularly harmonious social and human interactions between the characters of what seems to be an Icelandic social paradise. Halla’s role as a choir conductor, in search of harmony, seems to permeate all the characters of the film. For starters, as suggested earlier, the twin sisters are in harmony, to the point of adapting and modifying somewhat their life long goals in order to help one another; the government official keeps his secret to protect his friend Halla; the farmer shows great solidarity with Halla’s project, while not really knowing her at the start.\n\nOverall, Iceland seems, from this point of view, a haven of human interaction.\n\n# THE BIG PICTURE\n\nThrough this evolving story, there is the underlying suggestion that ecological consciousness and goals could be more likely, at least at the outset, in societies that are themselves, socially speaking, harmonious and well-functioning, as though the pre-existing harmony can provide a model and an inspiration for the harmony for larger entities, planet earth and the global sphere, even reaching out to children in Ukraine.\n\nBut, of course, as we move from smaller entities to larger ones, harmony is more difficult to achieve: more difficult on planet earth or in Ukraine than between twin sisters or between citizens of a democratic and well -functioning country like Iceland.\n\nOn the ranking of total citizen welfare, Iceland is ahead of many countries that we would spontaneously think of at first glance, once public health and security is taken into consideration. Once one’s own house is in order, it is easier to start thinking about planet earth, which is why Europe (and particularly Northern Europe) is, generally speaking and all things considered, leading the way into ecological consciousness.\n\nTo fully understand the film and, relatedly, the process which brings post-modern concerns, we have to go back to Maslow and Herzberg’s theories about the hierarchy of needs. Taking individual humans as examples, the hierarchy of needs perspective states that it is only when basic human needs are satisfied (safety, food, clothing, shelter) that higher needs (the need for achievement, and self-realization for example) can be addressed.\n\nAs is often the case, it is through a comparative perspective that we can fully appreciate the film and the dynamics that brings about citizens from Iceland, in this film, to be particularly interested in improving the environment.\n\nIn quite recent films coming out or Iran, for example, films like ***Capaharnaum*** and ***The Client***, it appears that some areas of the planet are so busy just surviving the difficult challenges of everyday human interaction that worrying about the state of the environment could be seen as a luxury.\n\nBut not in Iceland.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"The state of the environment is a serious subject, and this film addresses that important challenge.

Not that the construction is simple. Jesse’s cousin and prospective partner, nerdy and brainy Anton, is already under employment with a specialized organization involved in high speed cable research and wants to defect, so to speak, to Jesse’s project , under the protests of his previous female boss ( Salma Hayek), who feels betrayed by his move.\n\nBut Anton’s betrayal of his former employer is not the only difficulty of this ambitious project. Anton is a nerdy geek who works under pressure from Jesse to cut still more infinitely small time elements to the communication between these two unlikely points. In responding to Jesse’s coaching, he neglects his young family, something he will regret later. The project also has to traverse both public and private land, and Jesse sees to it that these potential obstacles are overtaken, through legal and not so legal means. Jesse is working under the assumption that everything, and everyone, has a price.\n\n# THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE FILM\n\nThere is in this film an elephant behind the screen. It is the idea of time. Indeed, this film is very much about time, in more ways than one. As can be predicted, the pristine state of the environment is not a factor to be considered by Jesse, and the pressure to finish the project quickly forces the participants to cut corners when dealing with the environment. This neglect is very much in line with German philosopher and ecologist Wolfgang Sachs’ observations, in *Planet Dialectics* (1999), that the will to save time, generally speaking, is not a friend of the survival of our planet. In very much the same spirit, in *Time and Being* (1927; 1962 in English), another German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, had described our Western technological societies as forgetting time, and by the same token, ourselves. And Jesse himself, upon learning that he developed stomach cancer, continues to work on the implementation of his time pressured project, neglecting by the same token his own health.\n\nThe film’s finale has the two cousins returning to a religious village enclave of Pennsylvania, living at a radically different pace than its contemporaries, drawing a strong contrast with the speed that Jesse and Anton were trying to achieve. In the final image, the two cousins help out in tasks of another age, helping the village leader in transporting some of the grain harvested by the village folks. In the meantime, their own unlikely project has failed, as Anton’s former boss, with some dirty tricks of her own, beats them to the finish line.\n\nObviously, this film offers food for thought. But what is it really about? Is it tied together and carried by some overarching element? Is there an elephant on the screen?\n\n# THE BIG PICTURE\n\nWe have mentioned time as a unifying element, as the elephant behind the film, and it is an unavoidable element of the film, even in its title.\n\nBut, in looking for the big picture, we are led to look at our conception of time as part of other contemporary developments.\n\nLet us first look at the world of finance. Current socio-economic critical theory has it that the current financial paradigm, with its abstract and disincarnated calculations, with its excesses and short term view, has taken over all of us, our human relationships, our countries, our governments, and our natural environments. Even traditional honest goods and services producing entities are taken over by this financial tsunami, at least in this view.\n\nThe compression of time leads us to look at one thing at a time, causing a lack of balance. Jesse is obsessed with his project of saving time for financial gain. It is a tunnel vision of things, a tendency of men more than of women, although women can become part of it, in a man’s world.\n\nIs this short term of time a particularly American phenomenon ?\n\nAt the outset of the film, Jesse recalls his first job, when after an error he made as a beginner in a plumbing contract, he was severely punished by his employer for his error. Later in the film, we learn that his employer was in fact his own father, who tried to instill in his son the idea of being strong and independent. His father was a Russian immigrant, intent on succeeding and seeing his son succeed in America.\n\nIs this, then, a story about America or about time in America? Is the American will to succeed quickly, at all costs, the elephant behind the screen? It is, after all, difficult to imagine a private cable network being planned in old Europe, traversing different countries of the European Union, including a plan to traverse thousands of kilometres of unbuilt land, including public land.\n\nTen years after the financially induced recession or 2008-2009, ***The Hummingbird project*** draws unwillingly the portrait of a mindset and a concept of time that set in motion those excesses, where abstract financial calculations, with minimal relations to real physical reality ( including time), had hijacked our world.\n\nThe 2008-2009 recession was a universal phenomenon. But the origins of its excesses and singlemindedness had a particularly American twist to it. Its short term view was the elephant in the room.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"When a construction project’s only goal is to save a few decimals of a second for stock market transactions, a lot of important elements are left behind and neglected.

The word « pupille », meaning a child still dependant on adults, is usually tied to « l’État », the state, so as to mean : « Pupille de l’État », a child of the French State, a child under the supervision of the state, or the government, usually temporarily.\n\n# THE STORY\n\n**(this is a spoiler alert: do not read this section if you wish to follow the plot only a the screening of the film)**\n\nA young unmarried mother leaves her newborn for adoption. It is just not the right time for her to have the responsibility of rearing a child. At the other end of the spectrum, a single woman, already in her early forties, is looking forward to welcoming a newborn in her home. She had a partner previously, and she had been on the list of prospective parents for several years. Married couples were evaluated higher than her (being now a single parent), but the couple just ahead of her in the list turned down the offer , as they , unexpectedly, learned they were to have a child of their own.\n\nIn a decidedly contrasting current view of government as a bundling and incompetent entity, social services are here presented as quite competent and caring, assuring continuity and stability in the midst of not so stable individual lives in the so called civil society. Not only looking at cases from a strictly bureaucratic view, individuals from the adoption services are attentive to individual needs and rights (rights to confidentiality, and to change one’s mind under certain time frames, for example). They go further than respect of the formal rules of law, they are genuinely compassionate. Even the application of the bureaucratic procedures appear fully justified and applied with circumspection.\n\nIt is not so much that individuals in the film, in contrast, are not responsible. It is just that they are….well…human. Couples form and then separate, there are changes and some degree of uncertainty surrounding individual lives. Yet, no one is pointed out as potential total failures, save one male prospective parent obviously unfit for parenthood and turned down with diplomacy by the attentive and perceptive government services.\n\nWhen looked at from the vantage point of their individual lives, the public adoption officials themselves, in the film, are not always immune to some form of personal uncertainty, although these elements do not affect their work negatively. It is as if their public persona transcends their private circumstances, and they grow to something more than themselves when confronted to their public duties.\n\n# THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE FILM\n\nObservers of the French bureaucracy, most notably Philippe d’Iribarne in his best seller *La logique de l’honneur* of 1989, have noticed this particularly French tendency to rise, at least outwardly, to the level of one’s public office. Without idealizing French bureaucracy, the failings of which have been abundantly documented over centuries, and without closing our eyes to the inevitable cases of corruption and incompetence in any large bureaucratic setting, there is nonetheless a certain idea of the *devoir* in France, the sense of mission, of duty, incumbent to public officials, even if only in public discourse.\n\nWith all the spotlight focussed on the global sphere, on the one hand, and the unavoidable and presumably perfectly harmonious cases of our interaction with our « loved ones », on the other hand, there stands the nuts and bolts of regular and currently unloved government, be it national, or state, or provincial. The film may well be a reality check to remind us that this level of human organization has not yet disappeared, and that, waiting for a more perfect world, it still assumes unavoidable responsibilities. This realization is the elephant in the film.\n\nIn the province of Québec ( Canada), a few decades ago, a group of sons and daughters of the locally famous authors of the *Refus global* (the *Refus global* was a letter of protest of the nineteen fifties against the presumed dark period of the Duplessis era) , had come out in the open to point out that their famous and heroic *Refus global* parents were themselves less than perfect, to say the least, in their parental duties. It was an unusual way to look at writers of a famous intellectual and artistic group, authors of an almost sacred Québec text.\n\nIn a similar development, some young men, who had been through the «Direction de la protection de la jeunesse», a Québec social agency overseeing problematic children from problematic parents, had come out to criticize a documentary film, itself documenting the failings of the DPJ, telling that, in their own cases, the DPJ had helped them along the way, contrary to the one sided documentary presentation. The right to speak one’s opinions sometimes gives way to unexpected results.\n\n# THE BIG PICTURE\n\nThe real subject of the film is not a defense of bureaucracy. It is simply a reality check about a level of human organization, public social services, which can contribute its activities to improving things, even though those activities are temporary and limited. No more, but no less.\n\nAlthough the film ***Pupille*** definitely has a French flavour to it, as the proportional size of the French public sector is sizeable, it is not completely without applying to other developed countries as well, exposed as they are to some of the failings of the nuclear family.\n\nOur continued reliance on public services, even though criticized and seen as irrelevant in the face of globalization, is part of the bigger picture. The elephant behind the film is that we still need, at least for the moment, this level of human organization.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"Public child protection agencies, like many government services, are often criticized and they  often take a beating in the media and public opinion.

Spain- France- Italy. With Penelope Cruz (as Laura) and Javier Bardem (as Paco).\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of German philospher Hans-Georg Gadamer’s significant legacies was to show that art, cinema in our case here, is an important tool to increase our knowledge about society. This is surely the case with ***Everybody knows***, a Spanish-French-Italian film released in late 2018.\n\nIn ***Everybody knows***, film director Asghar Farhadi (with a proven track record of two Oscars, among other prizes), tells of the unexpected series of events surrounding a marriage celebration in Spain.\n\n# THE STORY\n\n**(this is a spoiler alert : do not read this section if you wish to follow the plot only at the screening of the film).**\n\nThe story centers on Laura, a sister of the bride to be. Laura now lives in Argentina with a reputedly rich husband ( Alejandro), and she has made the trip to the small Spanish village of her youth for her sister’s wedding, with her two children ( a young son and a soon to be teenager daughter), as her husband stays home in Argentina because of pressing business appointments.\n\nAmong the other guests attending is Paco, Laura’s former sweetheart, who is now married and a prosperous landowner and wine producer.\n\nThe wedding celebrations, reminding the viewer of the opening scenes of the marriage celebrations in **Godfather I**, seems to be going fine. But amid the partying, Laura’s daughter is kidnapped from her room. A ransom is asked by the raptors through smart phone messages.\n\nIn the following events, all that seemed so perfect before and during the start of the wedding celebrations is put into question. A retired police investigator, called to investigate by a family member, concludes on an inside job, which puts into question the authenticity of the family ties. Laura’s husband, the supposedly rich businessman from Argentina, turns out, under scrutiny, to be ruined back home, and he (Alejandro) has been in reality looking for work for the last two years. But suspicion on him, to have in fact kidnapped his own daughter for financial gain, turns out to be unfounded.\n\nPaco, the wealthy wine grower and former Laura sweetheart, the mother of the kidnapped girl, turns out to be the one in charge of the crisis, a role he will only accentuate once he finds out what ***Everybody knows***, which is that he is the true biological father of the kidnapped girl.\n\nTurns out that when the sweethearts broke up, about twelve years ago, Laura needed money and, to get some, she sold to her soon to be estranged sweetheart Paco some land, the land that made him eventually prosperous. The family had always resented that deal. One of Lara’s sisters’ husband turns out to be the kidnapper behind the drama. It is Paco who pays the ransom money, in effect paying back a family member the value of the land he may have gained originally from duress.\n\nThe teenage daughter is then released and the family of the married daughter is left with the task of settling the case of the family in law culprit, who was in fact acting without the knowledge or the blessing of the family.\n\n# THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE FILM\n\nIt is not the first time that film director Asghar Farhadi deals with the strains of interpersonal dealings that have an economic dimension to them, as in ***The Client*** (2016), for example. But these challenging financial tensions were set in his native Iran. In this case, in ***Everybody knows***, the setting is contemporary and relatively prosperous Spain. Yet the underlying themes seem to be, in many ways, the same.\n\nIn the case of the Spanish setting, under the varnish of apparently harmonious and prosperous social and economic life, there are many underlying strains. There are dark secrets, hidden grievances, lies and questionable bases and suspect dealings behind apparently normal and legitimate prosperity.\n\n# THE BIG PICTURE\n\nAre these shaky bases and possibly immoral situations more prevalent, or somehow different, in some societies than in others? Would this be reflected in the films of specific countries?\n\nComing from the less developed world, and reflecting their own harsh economic realities, we can often notice these types of themes in films coming out of South America ( films recounting the insurance frauds coming from fake accidents, for example) or from Russia (***Taxi Blues***, a film on the disappointments and tensions vis-à-vis slow economic progress). Harsh individual circumstances are in such cases intertwined with economic difficulties. Our tunnel visions of studies of social reality, organized as they are in compartmentalized subject areas, in universities for example, do not often look at socio-economic realities and individual stories, taken together, but films and novels can. This is what is done in ***Everybody knows***. And, so, as Daniel Bertaux observed regarding his own work in sociology, « people know or at least feel that their curiosity about social life will not be (totally) satisfied by (a specialized domain), and we should acknowledge that film-makers do more to bring contemporary society to an awareness of itself than anyone else » (1).\n\nSo the elephant behind this film appears to be the inherent and often dramatic challenges of humans dealing with one another, especially when there is a financial and economic dimension. Specialists coming from Institutional economics would describe these challenges as « transactions costs », a term appearing as early as the late 1930’s, referring to the cost and inherent challenges of doing business and entertaining economic relations with one another.\n\nWas Farhadi’s intention to give a course on Institutional economics? Surely not. The deeper question here is: what are some of the underlying human elements beneath the surface of economic transactions?\n\nAnd, still more profoundly, what are institutions, starting with this most enduring and important institution, marriage and partnering? It may be revealing that the film opens with the preparation and celebrations of a marriage, the mother of all institutions.\n\nHowever imperfect, our institutions are all we have to regulate our economic dealings with one another. They are, in addition, the bases for all public life.\n\nIn commenting on the difficulties of specific countries in achieving democratic processes, we often identify the underlying cause as “political”.\n\nBut the bigger picture could point to a still larger cause: difficulties in dealing in everyday economic and social interactions, the big picture, the elephant behind the screen.\n\n(1) Daniel Bertaux, « From the life-history approach to the transformation of sociological practice », *Biography and Society*, Sage, Beverly Hills, California, 1981, p. 29-46, p. 42.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"A marriage celebration is of course a joyous occasion.
