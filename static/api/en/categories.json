In fact, one can say that the history of cinema mirrors the evolution of the 20th century, as cinema began with the beginning of the century itself.\n\nIn looking at these significant films of the past, movies which helped us look at the bigger picture of those times, we must however account for the fact we are, in part, looking at them with the eyes of the present. But that does not mean they only have the meaning we can see in them today. They were also very much part of the period they appeared in.\n\n[](<>)There is no doubt, for example, that ***The Godfather*** is a film which is very significant. In trying to find some of the underlying themes of this classic, we may be going beyond its thematic of the American mafia, and look at the film as a description of the gradual disappearance of the family as a dominant economic entity. All through the 20th century, corporations are taking precedence, ever since the landmark decision of Salomon v. Salomon (1896) split the personal responsibility from the corporate one, a decision which encouraged individuals to take a larger amount of risk in business, as they were not necessarily deemed to be personally responsible of all its corporate actions of the future.\n\nIn ***Godfather I***, the head of the family is still tied to his immediate environment. He does not want deal in drugs, because it would disrupt the neighbourhood. But, as the family grows its business from small enclaves of New York city to Cuba, La Vegas, and later Italy, the family progressively dissolves, to the point that the Corleone new boss and heir has his own brother killed. During that process of enlargement of activities, violence of another scale appears, a more impersonal and cold violence.\n\nAnd so, the film may in reality be about growing organizational scale in North America and in the world, as much as about the evolution of the mafia itself.\n\n\n\n***Dances with Wolves*** is another film for thought. One of its most revealing scene is when the North American Indian tribe members look sadly at a slaughtered buffalo herd, realizing that these animals were often killed only for some of their body parts, leaving the rest of the dead bodies to rot, a kind of metaphor for the advancing white culture and its accompanying specialized tunnel vision, so detrimental, according to Deep ecologists, to our environment. The conquering attitude of the original settlers, and the ensuing decay of the environment, was the elephant behind the film.","type":"Chronicles","slug":"films-of-the-past"},{"content":"","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","name":"Environment","type":"The elephants behind the Screen","slug":"environment"},{"content":"","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","name":"Economics","type":"The elephants behind the Screen","slug":"economics"},{"content":"","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","name":"Bullet comments","description":"In other postings on this site, we pointed out that, to identify the films that we make somewhat extensive specific comments on, we must look at many other films for which we will make less extensive comments.\n\nSome of these films could be amenable to hermeneutic understanding, but time constraints and other factors make it difficult to comment extensively on a very large number of films. In some cases, indeed in the majority of cases, we simply run dry, we have nothing to add, in terms of hermeneutic analysis, to what is quite obvious from just viewing the film itself. In other word, the Movie Shrink cannot add much.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid a risk: If indeed, hermeneutics is everything, and can apply to anything, then it runs the risk of being nothing.\n\nThat having been said, here are, nevertheless, some limited comments we can offer on a variety of relalively recent films. Some may give way, later, to more detailed analyses.\n\nAmong the films of late 2018 and early 2019 for which we will not report on here in detail , but which could be possibly lend themselves to a better understanding through hermeneutics, we will say a few words on some films from both North America and from outside our continent.\n\nIn North America, there are two themes which continue to draw attention, films on the experience of being black in America, on the one hand, and films about the rise of female consciousness, on the other hand. Quite often, these elements, not surprisingly, cana be objects of analysis.\n\n[](<>)In the case of the experience of being black in America, the films that look at this question are often quite straightforward and do not need much interpretation from The Movie Shrink. That is the case with ***The Green Book*, *If Beale Street Could Speak*, *Moonlight*** and** *Ma***. In the case of ***Get Out***, released earlier than the current year, there may be more implicit elements, which may need to be looked at. For example, the fact that blacks, in the home of the heroâ€™s white sweetheart, are kidnapped to use their body parts, is very intriguing and demands a second look. The implicit message, the elephant behind the film, as it were, might be that blacks are, yes, integrated in American society, but they are integrated only in specialized roles, not of course as body parts literally, but in very specialized roles, as musicians and sports figures for example. The more recent ***Us***, from the same director, is more difficult to decipher, and we will try to do this work more extensively in our regular section. This episode of a black family attacked by another black family, exactly similar to itself, as they are vacationing in their summer home near the beach, is very intriguing. It is difficult to identify the elephant behind the film. But because white families face the same danger in the small vacation village, it seems appropriate to take away an exclusively black interpretation to the film. Does the concluding images of the attackers, black and white, holding hands to traverse America from coast to coast suggests that , to find unity, we must first face our demons ? Possibly, but not entirely clear.\n\nStill on films produced in English, ***The Favorite*** and ***Mary, Queen of Scots***, both continue the rich vein of reassessing the role of women in society, a theme very present in recent years. A more recent aspect of this reassessment, present in both films, may be that the rivalry is less exclusively about men, or males, than other women. Whether that element is a sign of progress or of retreat is not altogether clear.","type":"Chronicles","slug":"bullit-comments"}]
