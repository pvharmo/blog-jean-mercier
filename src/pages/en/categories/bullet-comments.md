  In other postings on this site, we pointed out that, to identify the films
  that we make somewhat extensive specific comments on, we must look at many
  other films for which we will make less extensive comments.


  Some of these films could be amenable to hermeneutic understanding, but time constraints and other factors make it difficult to comment extensively on a very large number of films. In some cases, indeed in the majority of cases, we simply run dry, we have nothing to add, in terms of hermeneutic analysis, to what is quite obvious from just viewing the film itself. In other word, the Movie Shrink cannot add much.


  Also, we want to avoid a risk: If indeed, hermeneutics is everything, and can apply to anything, then it runs the risk of being nothing.


  That having been said, here are, nevertheless, some limited comments we can offer on a variety of relalively recent films. Some may give way, later, to more detailed analyses.


  Among the films of late 2018 and early 2019 for which we will not report on here in detail , but which could be possibly lend themselves to a better understanding through hermeneutics, we will say a few words on some films from both North America and from outside our continent.


  In North America, there are two themes which continue to draw attention, films on the experience of being black in America, on the one hand, and films about the rise of female consciousness, on the other hand. Quite often, these elements, not surprisingly, cana be objects of analysis.


  [](<>)In the case of the experience of being black in America, the films that look at this question are often quite straightforward and do not need much interpretation from The Movie Shrink. That is the case with ***The Green Book*, *If Beale Street Could Speak*, *Moonlight*** and** *Ma***. In the case of ***Get Out***, released earlier than the current year, there may be more implicit elements, which may need to be looked at. For example, the fact that blacks, in the home of the heroâ€™s white sweetheart, are kidnapped to use their body parts, is very intriguing and demands a second look. The implicit message, the elephant behind the film, as it were, might be that blacks are, yes, integrated in American society, but they are integrated only in specialized roles, not of course as body parts literally, but in very specialized roles, as musicians and sports figures for example. The more recent ***Us***, from the same director, is more difficult to decipher, and we will try to do this work more extensively in our regular section. This episode of a black family attacked by another black family, exactly similar to itself, as they are vacationing in their summer home near the beach, is very intriguing. It is difficult to identify the elephant behind the film. But because white families face the same danger in the small vacation village, it seems appropriate to take away an exclusively black interpretation to the film. Does the concluding images of the attackers, black and white, holding hands to traverse America from coast to coast suggests that , to find unity, we must first face our demons ? Possibly, but not entirely clear.


  Still on films produced in English, ***The Favorite*** and ***Mary, Queen of Scots***, both continue the rich vein of reassessing the role of women in society, a theme very present in recent years. A more recent aspect of this reassessment, present in both films, may be that the rivalry is less exclusively about men, or males, than other women. Whether that element is a sign of progress or of retreat is not altogether clear.
