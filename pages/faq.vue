      <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON UNDERSTANDING SIGNIFICANT FILMS</h1>
      <p>
        Whether from friends, colleagues, or from the web, here are a few
        frequently asked questions about our film site.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How does Understanding Significant films go about choosing the films it
        will comment on?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are some accidental elements to choosing films we will comment on.
        The films are chosen among the ones that are accessible to us in our own
        city, or on the web, or then again in a film festival we attend. There
        is no pretense to say that the films chosen are the most significant
        current films. But they are part of them. It is taken for granted that
        if we choose to comment on a film, it is that there is social meaning to
        it, usually implicit, a meaning we try to uncover and understand. But
        the meaning we will try to understand will not be going in all
        directions, there will have to be some common thread, some unity to it.
        Most often, the meaning we will uncover will be related to the elements
        of understanding we presented in our section on the on the Foundations
        of Understanding Significant Films. The sources mentioned there can be
        considered as our keys to understanding films, in this site.

      <h3>
        How does Understanding Significant Films go about in identifying what it
        considers as meaningful elements within a given film?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although we try to be as explicit and systematic as possible, the
        procedure is not really amenable to the standard procedures of
        scientific inquiry. At the outset, let us recognize that the films are
        not not chosen randomly, as stated earlier. There is a certain amount of
        intuition and experience involved. However, once the interpretation is
        presented, it must be defended and justified in the most objective way
        possible, it must be able to withstand criticism and contradictory
        opinions, much like in a court procedure. The essential goal is the
        identification of a central theme, expressed in many ways. This central
        theme is at the heart of what is looked for. If this central theme seems
        absent, there is no need for us to go further. In the cases we “come up
        empty” with, that is to say in most cases of the films we look at before
        making a choice, the film can have meaning and be socially relevant,
        even profound, but the hermeneutic method will not yield more than what
        can be gathered from casual observations. In some cases, the film
        director is very conscious of what he wants to say, to the point that
        his film is an advocacy for some cause, often political, as in the
        Costa-Gavras films of the 20th century, intent on revealing governmental
        corruption in South America and other parts of the world. The
        hermeneutic method, as we understand it, cannot add much in those cases,
        as with the documentary approach, where the opinion of the film maker is
        paramount and in a sense self-sufficient.

      <h3>
        Are there not as many interpretations as there are viewers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In In the view taken here, there is room for different interpretations,
        and these interpretations, although different, are not necessarily in
        opposition to each other. In our interactive site (XXXXXXX) there will
        be ample space for other interpretations, other elements of
        understanding. However, not all interpretations are equal. There are
        some interpretations which are, in the words of hermeneutics, « more
        adequate to the object ». Some interpretations are more enlightening. We
        are not, as suggested earlier, in a scientific scientific procedure, but
        that is not to conclude that everything is relative. There is the
        necessity to demonstrate the appropriateness of the proposed
        understanding and, as stated earlier, to defend it, much like in a
        trial, where absolute certainty cannot always be attained, and where,
        yet, a decision is made. We will add other elements to this “More on
        hermeneutics” section in later entries, but these opening comments
        constitute more information on the basic elements of our approach. And
        now, let us turn to some specific films ! Jean-Charles Mercier
