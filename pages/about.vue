      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding Significant Films is a commentary site that focusses on
        films that have something particularly meaningful to say to us about
        contemporary society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concentrating on a few dozen carefully chosen films a year from all over
        the planet, about two each month, the site begins by offering an
        informed analysis and interpretation of what these significant films
        tell us about what it is to be living in our times.
      </p>
      <h3>MORE ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        After viewing certain films, we often are left with some questions and
        the feeling that there was more to the story than its script told us :
        was there a lesson to be learned; what did the film director want to
        tell us, or is that relevant; or ,was there no message or meaning at all
        ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we would like to share those questions and our own
        understanding of the film with those of others. Alas, more often than
        not, our friends, family or colleagues have not viewed that specific
        film, and in fact have seen other films that we, ourselves, have not
        seen. So, with whom should we compare notes?
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding Significant Films constitutes a partial but specific
        answer to these questions. It is a meeting place, a forum for initiating
        a conversation, a dialogue for the understanding of particularly
        significant and complex films of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        All conversation or dialogue must begin with a specific statement.
        Understanding Significant Films thus begins, in this site, with an
        opening statement, in the form of a specific understanding and
        interpretation of the film that is under scrutiny. It gets, as it were,
        the ball rolling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once an interpretation, an understanding, has been offered on this site,
        readers can join the conversation at XXXXXXXX, to read comments coming
        from others who have viewed that film, and eventually participate in the
        exchanges by offering an understanding or interpretations of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In offering a specific interpretation for a film, to get the ball
        rolling, as suggested earlier, we need some guidelines that are explicit
        and methodical, yet flexible enough to adapt to the understanding of the
        specific film under study. With these guidelines, we try to avoid the
        risk that our analysis, understanding and interpretation become only a
        wild speculation or a uniquely personal view of the film that has been
        viewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, the next question becomes: is there a discipline, a tradition of
        sorts, that helps us navigate towards a better understanding of the film
        under scrutiny? We believe to have found such explicit yet flexible
        guidelines in the tradition of
        <nuxt-link to="/hermeneutics">hermeneutics</nuxt-link>.
      </p>
      <h3>STILL MORE ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding Significant Films proposes to begin the exchanges by using
        the hermeneutic approach, applied to films, to reach a better
        understanding of what can be considered as the larger story behind the
        specific and more limited story in the film.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underlying assumption of this site, indeed, is that art, and films
        in particular, say a lot about where we are, today, in the human story.
        Hermeneutics is involved, indeed, in the search for understanding when a
        work of art (in our case, a film) tells us something about where we are
        today, collectively, but says it in an indirect and understated way. The
        object of this site is to follow this hermeneutic road to understand
        films that present some intriguing and challenging elements which demand
        interpretation for a fuller understanding. The 1653 painting of
        Rembrandt, “Aristotle contemplating a bust of Homer”, represent the a
        visual model of what we want to achieve in this site: the poet (or, in
        our case, the filmmaker) tells a story, but the philosopher (in our case
        the interpreter or analyst of the film) offers an understandings that
        may go beyond the story that is told in the film and beyond the
        intentions of the creator (of filmmaker).
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not about the aesthetics of a film or its artistic merit.
        Again taking Rembrandt’s painting as an example and inspiration (see the
        painting shown on this site), Aristotle is not presumed to comment
        critically on Homer’s style of writing. In keeping with this spirit, not
        once will we comment on the artistic or creative aspects of a film (its
        photography or acting for example). Neither is our goal to take a moral
        or political stand on the film under study, taking it as an opportunity
        for criticizing capitalism or globalization for example. Our only goal
        is to understand what is challenging but also telling about a film and
        its social significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We assume however that the films we choose are significant and telling
        about the times we live in.

      <h3>WHAT THIS FILM SITE IS NOT</h3>
      <p>
        Before going further in describing what this site, Understanding
        Significant Films, is about, let us say a few words about what it is
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it is not about the intention of the author, screen writer,
        filmmaker or director. There is indeed no search about the intentions of
        the artist, of the writer or of the creator. We are interested in the
        outcome, the film itself, and believe that the film has a meaning beyond
        its creator, as the artists are not necessarily conscious of the
        richness of their creation. We are, on the other hand, very much
        interested in the opinion of the artist or film maker concerning his
        creation, but we are not tied by it. In this spirit, we want to draw,
        again, the reader’s attention to Rembrandts’ painting of 1653 “
        Aristotle contemplating a bust of Homer”(shown on this site), where the
        Greek philosopher Aristotle puts his hands on the head of Homer,
        suggesting that Aristotle will interpret and add to Homer’s rendition of
        Greek history. The film’s analyst- interpreter plays the role of
        Aristotle trying to understand more fully what Homer- the
        artist-creator- is expressing. In the view taken here, the ultimate
        creator of the work of art, or story, can be seen as society itself, and
        that story needs deciphering, beyond the work of the creator-artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, this site is not, as stated elsewhere, about the aesthetic
        dimension of films. Not once, will there be comments about the aesthetic
        qualities or weaknesses of the film, the quality of its photography or
        the work of its actors, for example. There are many sites and critics
        that address these important dimensions, but that will not be the focus
        here. We of course recognize that there are significant links between
        the style and the content of a film, but those links will not be the
        focus here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, there is no attempt here to analyze a film through some sort of
        explicit and pre-established formal procedure, whether semiotics or some
        other formal method. Hermeneutics is essentially a general guide and
        inspiration, not a detailed technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        No attempt, either, to espouse some militant or politically charged
        sub-text, conscious or not, criticising capitalism or globalization for
        example, as stated earlier. Such films will not be part of those looked
        at in this site. There are other venues for such political analyses of
        cinema production.
