  Although our main interest on this site are contemporary films, there were of
  course many, many significant films in the past and in the history of cinema.
  In fact, one can say that the history of cinema mirrors the evolution of the
  20th century, as cinema began with the beginning of the century itself.


  In looking at these significant films of the past, movies which helped us look at the bigger picture of those times, we must however account for the fact we are, in part, looking at them with the eyes of the present. But that does not mean they only have the meaning we can see in them today. They were also very much part of the period they appeared in.


  [](<>)There is no doubt, for example, that ***The Godfather*** is a film which is very significant. In trying to find some of the underlying themes of this classic, we may be going beyond its thematic of the American mafia, and look at the film as a description of the gradual disappearance of the family as a dominant economic entity. All through the 20th century, corporations are taking precedence, ever since the landmark decision of Salomon v. Salomon (1896) split the personal responsibility from the corporate one, a decision which encouraged individuals to take a larger amount of risk in business, as they were not necessarily deemed to be personally responsible of all its corporate actions of the future.


  In ***Godfather I***, the head of the family is still tied to his immediate environment. He does not want deal in drugs, because it would disrupt the neighbourhood. But, as the family grows its business from small enclaves of New York city to Cuba, La Vegas, and later Italy, the family progressively dissolves, to the point that the Corleone new boss and heir has his own brother killed. During that process of enlargement of activities, violence of another scale appears, a more impersonal and cold violence.


  And so, the film may in reality be about growing organizational scale in North America and in the world, as much as about the evolution of the mafia itself.




  ***Dances with Wolves*** is another film for thought. One of its most revealing scene is when the North American Indian tribe members look sadly at a slaughtered buffalo herd, realizing that these animals were often killed only for some of their body parts, leaving the rest of the dead bodies to rot, a kind of metaphor for the advancing white culture and its accompanying specialized tunnel vision, so detrimental, according to Deep ecologists, to our environment. The conquering attitude of the original settlers, and the ensuing decay of the environment, was the elephant behind the film.
